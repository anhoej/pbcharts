Description: Run charts and individuals control charts for statistical quality
    control and improvement. Control limits accommodate varying subgroup sizes
    as suggested by Taylor (2017)
    <https://variation.com/normalized-individuals-control-chart/> making 
    `pbcharts` useful for a wide range of measurement and count data and a
    convenient replacement for classic Shewhart control charts.
